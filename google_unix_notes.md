Should address:

* internals: filesystems, sockets, inode, system calls enables sockets
* systems: process & memory management, unix process management, how processes can communicate
* system calls, signals, the kernel, command lines, shell, network & application tracing
* Kernels, libraries, system calls, memory management, permissions, name-base servers, file systems, client-server protocols, understanding the shell.

>"Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs."
